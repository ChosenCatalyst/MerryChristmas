          My dearest friend, </br>
          if you don't mind </br>
          I'd like to join you by your side </br>
          </br>
          Where we could gaze into the stars </br>
          and sit together, now and forever </br>
          for it is plain, as anyone can see, </br>
          We're simply meant to be </br></br>

        <h1>Would It Be Okay?</h1>
        <h3>by Ryan Stiltz</h3>
        <p>
          Would it be ok if I took some of your time? </br>
          Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme? </br>
          Would it be ok if I opened my heart? </br>
          Would it be ok if I took on the part </br>
          Of being your man and showed you a view, </br>
          One that only a real man could do? </br>
          Would it be ok if I could make you smile? </br>
          Would it be ok if I held you awhile? </br>
          Would it be ok if I kissed your face? </br>
          Would it be ok if I were to replace </br>
          All the men in your past that just wouldn't do </br>
          And vow to be faithful and always be true? </br>
          Would it be alright to look in your eyes? </br>
          Would it be alright to never tell lies? </br>
          Would it be alright to find a way? </br>
          Would it be alright to long for the day </br>
          To pull you close and whisper in your ear </br>
          And tell you our feelings are nothing to fear? </br>
          Would it be ok if I took some of your time? </br>
          Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme? </br>
          To tell you there's nothing I'd rather do </br>
          Than spend my whole life loving only you... </br>

        <h1>My Everything</h1>
        <h3>by Emarah H.</h3>
        <p>
          Why are you so beautiful? </br>
          Why do you take my breath away? </br>
          How did I get so lucky? </br>
          How are you perfect in every single way? </br>

          Your laugh should be illegal because it's too cute. </br>
          I never want to spend a minute without you. </br>
          The way you kiss me takes my breath away. </br>
          Seeing you is the best part of my day. </br>
          You are so special, </br>
          And I'm glad that I can say you are mine, </br>
          Because when I'm with you I feel extraordinary </br>
          All of the time. </br>

        <h1>You Make Me</h1>
        <h3>Author Unknown</h3>
        <p>
          You make me laugh when I want to cry, </br>
          Make me live when I want to die, </br>
          Make me smile when I want to frown, </br>
          You turn my life upside down. </br>

          Believe in me when no one else does, </br>
          You're my now, my is, my was. </br>
          When you call my name I begin to blush, </br>
          I'm afraid people notice I need you so much. </br>

          when I'm with you time flies by fast. </br>
          It's like the present is the past. </br>
          I need you more than you can believe, </br>
          Love you more than you can conceive. </br>
          Think about you every night and day </br>
          And hope my life can stay this way </br>
          I don't want it to be any other way. </br>

        <p>
          Your lips so soft and red, </br>
          the thought of kissing you stuck in my head. </br>
          Your beauty so bright and warm, </br>
          shining through the darkest storm. </br>
          Your eyes sparkle like stars in the night sky, </br>
          when I stare into them I feel like I am soaring high. </br>
          My love for you is pure and true, </br>
          I never stop thinking of you. </br>
          The sound of you voice saying voice saying "I love you" </br>
          makes my hear pound </br>
          because I knew I'd truly found my one and only. </br>
          I promise to love you for every moment of forever, </br>
          and when everything else crumbles, I will never. </br>
          I am your armor to protect you from harm, </br>
          like you are to me, a lucky charm. </br>
          For you are my heart, my soul, </br>
          Baby, you are my whole world. </br>
