        <p>
          I built this website as a christmas gift for my girlfriend, whom I love quite dearly. </br>
          I wanted to do something memorable for her that she could show off to whoever she wanted to, whenever she wanted to.</br>
          So, if you're my girlfriend, Merry Christmas! I love you. And I hope you enjoy your gift!</br>

          Letter: This page is a "Dear Future Wife Letter". It's definitely directed </br>
          towards my girlfriend. But is in no way a proposal (...yet) or an assumption. </br>
          Things we should try: A list of all the things we have decided we need to do. </br>
          Poems for you: This is a collection of poems that I like and think you'll like.
