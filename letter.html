          Dear Future Wife, </br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; I want you to know, that I love you. I will cherish you and I will</br>
          do my best to take care of you for the rest of my life. I will be handful </br>
          at times, and I may not know what I've done wrong, but I won't go anywhere. </br>
          I'm not going to leave, and I'll do my best to become a better person, </br>
          someone worthy of you. I'll fix my mistakes and do my best to keep you happy. </br>
          I'm a little stubborn, but I'll try to keep an open mind and try new things. </br>
          I want to grow with you and start a family with you. You are the most important </br>
          person to me, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I don't </br>
          have a lot to offer, but I will give you everything I can. I love you. </br>
          I always have, and I always will.
        </p>
